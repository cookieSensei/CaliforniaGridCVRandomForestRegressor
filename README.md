# CaliforniaGridCVRandomForestRegressor

1 - Run the ipynb file on your jupyter notebook or colab to generate the random forest ML model.
2 - Use the py file to run the website, on the terminal type: 
  streamlit run model_deployment.py

This repo displays the power of random forest regressor trained efficiently using custom scikit-learn transformers and data pipelines which automates the data pre-processing. It's made with the help of the book "Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow" written by Honarable Aurelien Geron.
The website is made using streamlit which showcases the predictions made on user inputs.
